## ♾️ Problem Statement

Hot metal, Steel Ladle, and Scrap pot Tracking by auto-capturing the Ladle number and locations at SMS-1 and SMS-2.

## ♾️ Solution

- Here is a demonstration video of LadleVision in action:

- LadleVision relies on image processing and computer vision to detect and track ladles.
- Cameras are strategically placed to capture ladle images, and optical character recognition (OCR) identifies ladle numbers.
- A matching algorithm tracks ladles across different camera views, determining their locations. Ladle data, including numbers and positions, is transmitted to a central server in real time.
- This central server performs data analytics, providing insights like circulation times and maintenance predictions, optimizing ladle management.
